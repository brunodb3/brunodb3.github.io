Hey there! I'm Brunoâ€”a car enthusiast, gaming aficionado, and tech geek. Whether I'm navigating virtual wastelands in games like [Mad Max](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVWUbmzOGe4) or crafting code for real-world challenges, I thrive on diving deep into what makes things tick.

This site is my digital hub for sharing the stuff I like and feel passionate about. I've done a lot of things already, from working on [blockchain indexer tools](https://github.com/ltonetwork/indexer/graphs/contributors) to [video game development with Godot](https://brunodb3.itch.io/).

Curious about my journey so far? Check out my [career highlights](/career/) and let's connect over our shared love for gaming and geek culture! ðŸ˜„

So, grab your controller, fire up your imagination, and let's embark on this adventure together! ðŸš€
