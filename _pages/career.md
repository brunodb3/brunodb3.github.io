I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 10 years of experience in the industry. Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with cutting-edge technologies and leading innovative projects across various domains, including Web3, blockchain, game development, and cloud computing.

## About Me

Back in 2014 I started as a Junior Developer at Netxpert Sistemas, where I honed my skills in mobile development using Ionic and TypeScript. Over the years, I've taken on progressively challenging roles, from backend development at Midhaz to co-founding and serving as CTO at Ideware Sistemas. My journey has allowed me to explore diverse areas, from creating chatbots and mobile apps to leading teams and mentoring students. I moved to The Netherlands in 2019 to work for Aegon/HCL as a Tech Lead, and ended up staying there for almost 5 years. There I shifted my focus to the Web3 industry working with LTO Network, eventually leading to working for My Neighbor Alice to make a blockchain-based videogame.

Now, I find myself residing in the Bay Area in sunny California. I'm excited to see what the future brings!
