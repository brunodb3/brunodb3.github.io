## Tools used

This website was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

## Building the website locally

Make sure to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and its dependencies installed.

Navigate to the root of the project and install the project's dependencies:

```sh
